This repo does basic multiple linear regression analysis using R to analyze the fuel economy of cars using data from *Motor Trends* provided through the [datasets package in R](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html).  

This project is part of the Regression Models class within the Data Science Specialization on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/regmods), taught by [Dr. Brian Caffo](https://github.com/bcaffo) of Johns Hopkins University. Specifications for the project are available on the [course website](https://class.coursera.org/regmods-013/human_grading).
